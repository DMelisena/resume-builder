\section*{SUMMARY}

Motivated, detail-oriented engineer with a strong passion for learning, experimenting, and solving complex problems. I enjoy building practical solutions from scratch, exploring new technologies, and improving systems with structured, data-driven thinking. Experienced on using python for particle simulations for nuclear health application and ML pipeline for video based fish identification application. I have been daily driving unix based operating system for four years. I am proficient with advanced Git workflows including interactive rebasing, custom patch creation and clean version control.

\section*{PROJECT EXPERIENCE}

\textbf{Sealens} \hfill Bali, Indonesia

\textit{AI Engineer} \hfill \textit{Jul 2025 - Present}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Held an in depth research regarding possible solution concept that could help coral restoration communities.
\item Conduct technical feasibilities and CI for iOS development.
\item Designed and implemented a comprehensive end-to-end ML pipeline covering dataset creation, video preprocessing, object detection, deep feature extraction, clustering, classification, re-identification, quantitative evaluation, and deployment-ready inference flows.
\item Built a modular and scalable MLOps framework leveraging DVC to version-control 60k+ images, raw videos, cleaned datasets, model checkpoints, embeddings, and experiment artifacts, ensuring full reproducibility across the machine learning lifecycle.
\item Developed and benchmarked multiple object detection and classification models—including YOLOv11/v12, ResNet, Vision Transformers, Siamese networks, and custom CNN architectures—to support experimentation and continuous model improvement.
