\begin{rSubsection}{Sealens}{Jul 2025 - Present}{AI Engineer}{}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Held an in depth research regarding possible solution concept that could help coral restoration communities.
\item Conduct technical feasibilities and CI for iOS development.
\item Designed and implemented a comprehensive end-to-end ML pipeline covering dataset creation, video preprocessing, object detection, deep feature extraction, clustering, classification, re-identification, quantitative evaluation, and deployment-ready inference flows.
\item Built a modular and scalable MLOps framework leveraging DVC to version-control 60k+ images, raw videos, cleaned datasets, model checkpoints, embeddings, and experiment artifacts, ensuring full reproducibility across the machine learning lifecycle.
\item Developed and benchmarked multiple object detection and classification models—including YOLOv11/v12, ResNet, Vision Transformers, Siamese networks, and custom CNN architectures—to support experimentation and continuous model improvement.
\item Created an automated cluster analysis system using DBSCAN, KMeans, and PCA to cluster the cropped images.

\begin{rSection}{Summary}
Motivated, detail-oriented engineer with a strong passion for learning, experimenting, and solving complex problems. I enjoy building practical solutions from scratch, exploring new technologies, and improving systems with structured, data-driven thinking. Experienced on using python for particle simulations for nuclear health application and ML pipeline for video based fish identification application. I have been daily driving unix based operating system for four years. I am proficient with advanced Git workflows including interactive rebasing, custom patch creation and clean version control.
